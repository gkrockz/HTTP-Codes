## HTTP-Status-Codes

#### 🔁 How it works:
  

1️⃣ Enter any status code that you want to know about.
  
2️⃣ An image will be displayed, by which one can easily understand what kind of response that the status code denotes.

> **HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes**:
> 1. Informational responses (100–199)<br>
> 2. Successful responses (200–299)<br>
> 3. Redirection messages (300–399)<br>
> 4. Client error responses (400–499)<br>
> 5. Server error responses (500–599)<br>

> **Note:** Images / Gifs are limited to few HTTP response status codes only.
